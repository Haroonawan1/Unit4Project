    public boolean getDead()
        The method returns if the user is dead or not.

    public String stageCoach()
        The method will use Math.random() to determine how easily the user robs a stagecoach and how many people the user will fight. The money gotten
        from the robbery is returned as a string with the information about the crime. Fights are simulated using the fight() method. Crime will decrease honor.

    public String train(String t)
        The method will use Math.random() and t to determine if the user finds a train. Math.random() will be used to determine how many people the user will fight.
        and how much money is found. The money found from the robbery is returned as a string with the information about the crime. Fights are simulated using the
        fight() method. Crime will decrease honor.

    public String bank()
        The method will take a integer x, and use it to determine how easily the user robs a train and how many people the user will fight. The money gotten
        from the robbery is returned as a string with the information about the crime. Fights are simulated using the fight() method. Crime will decrease honor.

    public String crime(int x, String t)
        This method will take a int, x, which will determine which crime the user wants to do and string, t, to see what time the user will do the crime. The three
        crimes consist of robbing a stagecoach, robbing a train, and robbing a bank. A string containing the results of the crime chosen will be returned and the variable
        money will be updated.

    public void goodDeed(String s)
        This method will take a string, s, which will determine which good deed the user wants to do. The three good deeds consist of giving someone a ride
        home, intervening in a fight, and giving money to the poor. These will increase honor. There is a chance doing a good deed will allow the user to find
        a hint, if so the hint() method runs.

    public String hint()

    public String fight(int x)
        This method contains four enemies the user can fight including their health and attack. The method will take x and will use the number to determine how
        many people the character will fight. Each fight will be done using math in a turn based and the enemy will be selected by random. The results of each fight
        will be a added to a string which will then be returned. If the user's health reaches 0 and they die, the method will stop early.

    public void bounty()
        This method will print out information about the four gang members that are currently in jail such as how much it cost to pay their bounty and how many
        days remain until they are executed. If the user has enough money they will be prompted to pay the bounty of a member of the gang and if they do the
        variable saved will be increased.

    public          shop

    public String end()
        The method will return a string which has details containing the ending of the game. The ending which is selected and displayed will be determined by how many
        members the user has saved and their honor. There are unique ending for cases such as the user dying due to having no remaining health and the user selecting to
        end the game.
