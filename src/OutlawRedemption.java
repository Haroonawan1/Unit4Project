                    1) The objective of the game is to raise enough money in order to pay off the bounty of your fellow gang members
                    2) You can obtain money by doing crimes (some are harder than others), however this will affect your honor
                    3) You can improve your honor by doing good deeds, thankful people may help you
                    4) Go to the shop to heal and get better weapons to improve your chances in fights
                    5) Save your members before they are hanged, each member has a certain amount of days until they are hanged
                    6) Your honor and the amount of people you have saved will effect your ending
                    7) GOOD LUCK!
